// Checkpoint 3.1 How would you compare lists in python vs arrays in JavaScript
// Answer: python: flexibility in data types, JS: holds single data type.

// Your code here

// Checkpoint 3.2 What would be the equivalent of objects in python? How would you compare them?
// Answer: dictionaries. (But can also be classes): each values can be accessed by the corresponding key. 

// Todo 3.6 Going back to the array of numbers, use the spread syntax to create a copy of the array with an additional number
// Your code here
numbers = [...numbers, 999];

// Your code here
